# Trip_Assistant_Chatbot

In this project, i have designed a chatbot by using
Android and JAVA. It works like a virtual travel agent
which help users to plan their trip in efficient manner and
simplifying the process of solving the queries and
requirements of the user. I had used "Brainshop API"
website to generate and train our API. I had created
MessageModal, MessageRVAdapter, and MainActivity
classes. MessageModal class represents a chat message
with sender. While MesageRVAdapter class is an Android
RecyclerView Adapter for displaying chat messages in an
application. In MainActivity class, all the views and
variables throught an application are initialized. Also, I
had created user, bot and MainActivity layout files for
defining the layout and structure of the user interface.

It is useful to both customer and travel company for the company itâ€™s boost operational efficiency 
and bring the cost saving for it. And for the customer it added services to internal employees and 
external customer and also reduce the need for human interaction.
The traveler are looking through so many websites to find the best trip and search about the place 
which they going to visit and to plan according to it. But the chatbot gave this all information on 
a single platforms so by using chatbots it increase the engagement of the customer.
